<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and, with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade. Budget-friendly steaks, however, benefit tremendously from marination. You'll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes!</p>
